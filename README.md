## About UNISOLAR Dataset

UNISOLAR is a large-scale open dataset on UNIversity SOLAR energy generation through PV systems.This dataset is publicly released as part of La Trobe University’s commitment to Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2029, for which we are building the La Trobe Energy AI/Analytics Platform (LEAP) that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Analytics to analyse, predict and optimize the consumption, generation and utilization of electricity, renewables, gas and water resources. UNISOLAR contains solar generation data for solar sites across La Trobe’s five campuses in geographically distributed regions, apprximately across two and a half years, 2020 January-2022 April. The solar generation data is at 15-minute granularity and solar irradiance at hourly intervals. UNISOLAR also contains weather data from the closest weather station to each campus, averaged at 15-minute time intervals along with monthly summarized data and meta data of PV solar sites.
A high granularity data dictionary and technical validation of the dataset for forecasting are further contributions of this article that will enable interested research scientists, academics, industry practitioners, sustainability and energy consultants to experiment and evaluate their AI algorithms, models, forecasts, as well as inform the development of energy benchmarks, guidelines and much needed data-driven energy policies. 

All the data available in the dataset are stored in CSV format. Detailed Information about the complete dataset can be found in UNISOLAR paper in [[1]](#1)
